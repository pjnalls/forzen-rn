    description: `Meditation is a simple process for the same reason we want to devote ourselves to something and "pay" attention. If attention is divided and paid needlessly, how do we expect to have enough attention to pay for what we really want? Simplify life to the extent it is healthy for you while in meditative states and pay attention to the results.`,
